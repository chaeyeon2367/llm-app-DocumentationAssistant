## Project Overview

The Langchain ðŸ¦œðŸ”— Documentation Chat Assistant allows users to ask questions about Langchain, a topic they are studying or curious about, and receive responses from a chatbot. The chatbot's responses are generated based on the information available in the Langchain documentation. To provide transparency and traceability, each response includes a source URL indicating the specific section of the Langchain documentation from which the information was derived.

### Key Features

- **GPT Model Turbo 3.5**: The chatbot is powered by the GPT model Turbo 3.5, allowing it to generate natural and contextually relevant responses to user queries.
- **PineconeðŸŒ² Vector Database**: Utilizes Pinecone for vector database management, enabling similarity search to extract relevant information from the vector space.
- **RetrievalQA Chain**: Implements a RetrievalQA chain for prompt augmentation, enhancing the chatbot's ability to provide accurate and informative responses.
- **Streamlit User Interface**: The frontend of the application is built using Streamlit, providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for interacting with the chatbot.
- **LLM Memory**: Utilizes LLM memory to store chat history and maintain context, enabling the chatbot to provide coherent responses based on previous interactions. This enhances the conversational flow and improves the overall user experience.
- **Source URL Display:** The application displays the source URL of the information used to generate the answer, allowing users to verify and explore further if needed.
